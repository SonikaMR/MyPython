#Now let's create a coin toss program that will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails" using Random module
#For that, we must generate a number (either 0 or 1) first
#If it is 1 then we must print "Heads" or otherwise, it's "Tails

import random
coin_toss = random.randint(1,2)
if coin_toss == 1:
  print("Heads")
else:
  print("Tails")
  
o/p: Tails
