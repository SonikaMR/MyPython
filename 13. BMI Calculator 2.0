BMI CALCULATOR 2.0 (using if-else statements)

#in the previous BMI calculator, there will only be the calculation of BMI of a person using their height and weight
#but here, we are going to calculate whether that person is under weight or normal or is suffering from obese
#for that, we are going to categorize their BMI value using if-else statements

height = float(input("Enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
bmi = weight / height ** 2
print(f"Your BMI is {round(bmi,2)}")
if bmi < 18.5:
  print("You are under-weight")
elif bmi <= 25:                 #since the values below 18.5 are already tested as false, there is no need to write it as (18.5 <= bmi <= 25)
  print("You are normal-weight")
elif bmi <= 30:
  print("You are slightly over-weight")
elif bmi <= 35:
  print("You are obese")  
else:
  print("You are clinically obese")

o/p: Enter your height in m: 1.62
     Enter your weight in kg: 60
     Your BMI is 22.86
     You are normal-weight
