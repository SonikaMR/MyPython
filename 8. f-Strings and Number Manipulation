F-STRINGS and NUMBER MANIPULATION

f-Strings: f-Strings are used to convert any given type of the variable to strings.

Eg)
name = "Sonika"
age = 21
height = 1.61
myDetails = True
print("My name is " + name + ", my age is " + str(age) + ", my height is " + str(height) + " and all the details I've given is " + str(myDetails));

#Since converting each and every type to string is really painful and where f-Strings comes in really handy 
#In order to convert each and every type of the variable to string by using str(), we can simply use f-Strings by adding 'f' before the double quotes
#Also, we must use { and } to insert variables and no need of using any '+' signs

print(f"My name is {name}, my age is {age}, my height is {height} and all the details I've given is {myDetails}")

o/p: My name is Sonika, my age is 21, my height is 1.61 and all the details I've given is True


NUMBER MANIPULATION:

#Usually dividing 2 numbers returns a float value with recurring decimal digits like,
print(8/3)

o/p: 2.6666666666

#Using int() will convert the result to an integer number
print(int(8/3))

o/p: 2

#But still it won't be an accurate answer and hence round() comes in handy. It rounds off the result to a precise value
print(round(8/3))

o/p: 3

#Also, we can decide how many decimal digits must be displayed by using round(number, digit) 
print(round(8/3 , 2)

o/p: 2.67

#We can also use Floor Division, where it produces the final result in integer value
print(8//3)
print(type(8//3)

o/p: 2
     <class 'int'>
