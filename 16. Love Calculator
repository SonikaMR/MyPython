LOVE CALCULATOR (using if-else)

#in this program, we are going to test the compatibility between 2 people
#To work out the love score between two people:

1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs
2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs
3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

#for this, we are going to use 2 functions:
1. lower(): The lower() function changes all the letters in a string to lower case.
2. count(): The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.

print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is your lover's name? \n")
name = name1.lower() + name2.lower() 
T = name.count('t') 
R = name.count('r')
U = name.count('u') 
E = name.count('e') 
L = name.count('l') 
O = name.count("o") 
V = name.count('v') 
add1 = T + R + U + E
add2 = L + O + V + E
add = int(str(add1)+str(add2))
if add < 20:
  print(f"Your score is {add}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif add < 40:
  print(f"Your score is {add}, obstacles are ready to test your love")
elif add < 60:
  print(f"Your score is {add}, You look great together")
elif add < 80:
  print(f"Your score is {add}, Love is in the air")
elif add < 100:
  print(f"Your score is {add}, Romance dwells between you")
else:
  print(f"Your score is {add}")
