LOVE CALCULATOR (using if-else)

#in this program, we are going to test the compatibility between 2 people
#To work out the love score between two people:

1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs
2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs
3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

#for this, we are going to use 2 functions:
1. lower(): The lower() function changes all the letters in a string to lower case.
2. count(): The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.\

#if the love score is less than 20, then print the message as: "You go together like coke and mentos!"
#if the love score is less than 40, then print the message as: "Obstacles are ready to test your love!"
#if the love score is less than 60, then print the message as: "You look great together!"
#if the love score is less than 80, then print the message as: "Love is in the air!"
#if the love score is less than 100, then print the message as: "Romance dwells between you!"
