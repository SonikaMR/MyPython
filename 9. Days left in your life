DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS LEFT IN YOUR LIFE (Not taking leap year into account)


#let us assume that you are going to live until age 60 and calculate how many days, weeks and months are left for you to live your life.
Age = input("What's your current age? ")
Years = 60 - int(Age)
Days = round(Years * 365)
Weeks = round(Years * 52)
Months = round(Years * 12)
print(f"You have {Days} days, {Weeks} weeks, and {Months} months left.")

o/p: What's your current age? 21
     You have 14235 days, 2028 weeks, and 468 months left.
