RANDOMIZATION IN PYTHON:

#In order to generate numbers and characters randomly, we use Randomisation.
#The Python standard library provides a module called RANDOM that offers a variety of functions for generating random numbers.
#These functions are entirely dependent on Pseudo-Random Number Generation method.
#Python uses a popular and robust pseudo-random number generator called the Mersenne Twister.


PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS:

#The source of randomness that we inject into our programs and algorithms is a mathematical trick called a pseudorandom number generator.
#Pseudorandomness is a sample of numbers that look close to random, but were generated using a deterministic process.
#For better understanding of this concept, do visit

#This video articulates the concept behind the pseudo-random number generator in a brilliant way.


RANDOM MODULE:
#Random module in Python is used to generate pseudo-random numbers for various probabilistic distributions.
#To bring in the Random module in a python program, we must use IMPORT keyword.
#Some main functions: 

1)RANDINT(a,b): randint(a,b) is used to produce a random integer, encompassing a and b and also a must always be lesser than b.
  Eg)  import random
       random_int = random.randint(1,100)
       print(random_int)
   
  o/p: 45

2)RANDOM(): generates a random number between [0.0 to 1.0) (where 1 is not inclusive)
   Eg)  import random
        random_int = random.random()
        print(random_float)
   
   o/p: 0.8085510649968928
