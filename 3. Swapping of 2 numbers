SWAPPING OF 2 NUMBERS:

(a) USING A THIRD VARIABLE:

A = input("The Value of A before swapping is: ")
B = input("The Value of A before swapping is: ")
C = A
A = B
B = C
print("The Value of A after swapping is: " + A)
print("The Value of B after swapping is: " + B)

o/p: The Value of A before swapping is: 3
     The Value of A before swapping is: 5
     The Value of A after swapping is: 5
     The Value of B after swapping is: 3

(b) WITHOUT USING A THIRD VARIABLE:

A = input("The Value of A before swapping is: ")
B = input("The Value of B before swapping is: ")
#just switch the variables around in the print function at the end
print("The Value of A after swapping is: " + B)
print("The Value of B after swapping is: " + A)

o/p: The Value of A before swapping is: 3
     The Value of B before swapping is: 5
     The Value of A after swapping is: 5
     The Value of A after swapping is: 3
