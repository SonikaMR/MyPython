BASIC PRINT() EXAMPLES:

PRINT: Print() is a function that is used to print a specified message in the output screen

(1)
#in order to print a string, we must use quotations, either ' or ", within which we write the specified message
print("Hello World")

o/p: Hello World

(2)
#it is easy to perform mathematical calculations inside print()
print(10 + 20)

o/p: 30

(3)
#input() is a function that is used to get input from the user
print("Hello " + input("What's your name: "))

o/p: What's your name: Sonika
     Hello Sonika
     
(4)
print(len(input("What's your name: "))

o/p: What's your name: Sonika
     6
     
(5)
num_char = len(input("What's your name: "))
#you must convert the type of 'num_char' from integer to string in order to get that printed, otherwise It'll give you a TypeError
#With or without a variable, either way you can convert it

#Without vaiable : 
print("There are " + str(num_char) + " letters in your name!")

#With variable :
Conversion = str("'") + str(num_char) + str("'")
print("There are " + Conversion + " letters in your name!")

o/p: What's your name: Sonika
     There are '6' letters in your name!
