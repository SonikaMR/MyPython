IF-ELSE CONDITION

SYNTAX:
      if (condition):           
        block of statement(s)   
      else:                     
        block of statement(s)
        
#colon at the end of the if/else statement is must
#indentation at the block of statements is must
#indentation here means that this particular block of code must run if the 'if' condition is true

Eg):
#if you are a ticket seller for roller coaster in a theme park and you must allow kids taller than 150cm
#if they are not satisfying this condition, then they aren't allowed to ride

print("Welcome to the Theme Park!\nHave a happy day!!")
height = int(input("What's your height? "))
if height >= 150:
  print("You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!\nEnjoy!")
else:
  print("Sorry Kid, you aren't allowed to ride the Roller Coaster.\nBetter Luck next time!")
  
o/p: Welcome to the Theme Park!
     Have a happy day!!
     What's your height? 180
     You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!
     Enjoy!

#suppose if there is a condition in price of the tickets such that the ticket price of a person under age 12 will be Rs.10
#The ticket price of a person aged between 12 to 18 is Rs.20 and for the person aged above 18 is Rs.30
#Now here, to satisfy this condition, we are now to use the NESTED IF-ELSE STATEMENTS

NESTED IF-ELSE CONDITION:

SYNTAX:
      if (condition):
          block of statements
        
          if (condition):
            block of statements
          elif (condition):
            block of statements
          else:
            block of statements
      
      else:
        block of statements
        
ELIF: If there are more than 1 condition, then elif is used.

Eg):

print("Welcome to the Theme Park!\nHave a happy day!!")
height = int(input("What's your height? "))
if height >= 150:
  print("You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!\nEnjoy!")
  age = int(input("What's your age? "))
  if age < 12:
    print("Please pay Rs.10!")
  elif 12 <= age <= 18:
    print("Please pay Rs.20!")
  else:
    print("Please pay Rs.30!")
else:
  print("Sorry Kid, you aren't allowed to ride the Roller Coaster.\nBetter Luck next time!")
  
o/p: Welcome to the Theme Park!
