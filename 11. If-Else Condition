IF-ELSE CONDITION

SYNTAX:
      if (condition):           
        block of statement(s)   
      else:                     
        block of statement(s)
        
#colon at the end of the if/else statement is must
#indentation at the block of statements is must
#indentation here means that this particular block of code must run if the 'if' condition is true

Eg):
#if you are a ticket seller for roller coaster in a theme park and you must allow kids taller than 150cm
#if they are not satisfying this condition, then they aren't allowed to ride

print("Welcome to the Theme Park!\nHave a happy day!!")
height = int(input("What's your height? "))
if height >= 150:
  print("You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!\nEnjoy!")
else:
  print("Sorry Kid, you aren't allowed to ride the Roller Coaster.\nBetter Luck next time!")
  
o/p: Welcome to the Theme Park!
     Have a happy day!!
     What's your height? 180
     You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!
     Enjoy!



#suppose if there is a condition in price of the tickets such that the ticket price of a person under age 12 will be Rs.10
#The ticket price of a person aged between 12 to 18 is Rs.20 and for the person aged above 18 is Rs.30
#Now here, to satisfy this condition, we are now to use the NESTED IF-ELSE STATEMENTS

NESTED IF-ELSE CONDITION:

SYNTAX:
      

SYNTAX:
      if (condition):
          block of statements
        
          if (condition):
            block of statements
          elif (condition):
            block of statements
          else:
            block of statements
      
      else:
        block of statements
        
ELIF: If there are more than 1 condition, then elif is used.

Eg):

print("Welcome to the Theme Park!\nHave a happy day!!")
height = int(input("What's your height? "))
if height >= 150:
  print("You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!\nEnjoy!")
  age = int(input("What's your age? "))
  if age < 12:
    print("Please pay Rs.10!")
  elif 12 <= age <= 18:
    print("Please pay Rs.20!")
  else:
    print("Please pay Rs.30!")
else:
  print("Sorry Kid, you aren't allowed to ride the Roller Coaster.\nBetter Luck next time!")
  
o/p: Welcome to the Theme Park!
     Have a happy day!!
     What's your height? 162
     You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!
     Enjoy!
     What's your age? 21
     Please pay Rs.30!


#A very common thing in riding a roller coaster is that, we all tend to take pictures as like riding in it.
#But for that we must pay some money 
#Therefore, in order to sum up the bill along with that money, we will be needing another IF condition
#but in cases like this, we won't be needing an ELSE statement, and hence there comes multiple IF statements in handy.

MULTIPLE IF STATEMENTS:

SYNTAX:
      if (condition 1):
            do A
      if (condition 2):
            do B
      if (condition 3):
            do C
            
#no need of ELSE in this type
#if the conditions are found to be true, then their block of statements will be performed
#if all the conditions are true, then everything will be performed
#we can use as many as IF statements we need, as per the problem we are working into 

Eg):
#now we're going to add the Picture column right after the age condition is done
#since every customer will not be willing to picture them while they are riding, we must ask them
#if they are willing, then we must sum up the price of taking a picture along with the original final bill
#and for that, we must create a variable Bill

print("Welcome to the Theme Park!\nHave a happy day!!")
height = int(input("What's your height? "))
bill = 0
if height >= 150:
  print("You are allowed to ride the Roller Coaster!\nEnjoy!")
  age = int(input("What's your age? "))
  if age < 12:
    bill = 10
    print("Please pay Rs.10!")
  elif age <= 18:
    bill = 20
    print("Please pay Rs.20!")
  else:
    bill = 30
    print("Please pay Rs.30!")
  picture = input("Are you willing to take a picture while riding? Y or N: ")
  if picture == 'Y':
    bill += 15
    print(f"Your final bill is {bill}") 
else:
  print("Sorry Kid, you aren't allowed to ride the Roller Coaster.\nBetter Luck next time!")
