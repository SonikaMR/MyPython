DATA-TYPES: Data Types are the classification or categorization of data items.

type(): It is a function which is used to identify the type of data given to a variable.


BASIC DATA-TYPES IN PYTHON WITH EXAMPLES:

(A) INTEGERS (int): Numbers without any decimal places (ie) whole numbers (considering both positive and negavtives numbers)
    Eg): a = 123
         print(type(a))
         
    o/p: <class 'int'>
    
    Eg): print(12 + 12)
         print(12_34 + 12_12) #Underscores between numbers represent the commas that we usually use in-between (like 1,00,000)
         print(12_3 + 1_234) #12_3 = 12,3; 1_234 = 1,234
         
    o/p: 24
         2446
         1357
    
(B) FLOATING POINT (float): Floating Point Numbers are numbers with decimal places (fractional)
    Eg): b = 12.34
         print(type(b))
         
    o/p: <class 'float'>
    
    Eg): print(10.5 + 11.2) #even if you add an integer number with a floating point number, the final result will be in float only
         print(10.5 + 15) #It'll convert the integer number to float automatically)
   
    o/p: 21.7
         25.5
    
(C) STRINGS (str): Strings are sequences of character data which are delimited using either " or '
    Eg): c = "Hello"
         print(type(c))
         
    o/p: <class 'str'>
    
(D) BOOLEAN (bool): Boolean are interpreted to represent whether something given is true or false
                    It has only two values -> True and False
                    (both must start with capital letters only and no need to be delimited with quotations)
                    
    Eg): d = True
         e = False
         print(type(d))
         print(type(e))
         
    o/p: <class 'bool'>
         <class 'bool'>
