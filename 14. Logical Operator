LOGICAL OPERATORS

Logical Operators: Its is used for checking multiple conditions in the same line of code

#there are 3 types of logical operators:

1. AND: If both the conditions are found to be true, then the whole IF condition is satisfied(said to be true) 
        If we combine 2 different conditions (say A and B) using 'and' operator, they both must be true
        If at all, either one is false (or both of them are false), then the whole If statement is evaluated to be false
        Eg):
             a = 12
             if a > 10 and a < 13: #here, both the conditions are true and hence IF statement is performed
               print("Perfect!")
             
             o/p: Perfect!
        
2. OR: In Or Operator, it's not compulsory that both must be true for the entire line of code to be true
       So If C or D is true or if they are both true, then it will be evaluated to be true
       If only when both C and D are false, the final result actually becomes false
       Eg):
            a = 12
            if a > 15 or a < 13: #here, even though, only the 2nd condition is true, the IF statement is still executed
              print("Perfect!")
            
            o/p: Perfect!
       
3. NOT: It's job is to reverse the condition (ie), if a condition is said to be false, it reverses it to true
        If the condition is said to be true, then it becomes false by using NOT operator
        Eg):
             a = 12
             if not a == 12:         #Since a = 12 is true, but NOT operator is used and hence IF statement becomes false
                 print("Perfect!")
             else:
                 print("It's okay!")
             
             o/p: It's okay!
