VARIABLES : Variables are containers used for storing values.


BASIC EXAMPLES OF USAGE OF VARIABLES IN PYTHON:

(1)
#Name is the variable used here
Name = "Sonika"
print(Name)

o/p: Sonika

(2)
Name = "Sonika"
Name = "InsaneSo"
print(Name)

o/p: InsaneSo

(3)
Name = "Sonika"
print(Name)
Name = "InsaneSo"
print(Name)

o/p: Sonika
     InsaneSo

(4)
#a and b are variables 
#10 and 20 are the values assigned to the variables respectively
a = 10
b = 20
print(a+b)

o/p: 30

(5)
#Here, Name and Length are variables
Name = input("What's your name: ")
Length = len(Name)
#len() is a built-in function where it can be used to get the length of any given string, array, list, etc,.
print(Length)

o/p: What's your name: Sonika
     6
